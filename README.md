### Learning objectives and expected outcomes

- Familiarise participants with the concept of genomic epidemiology and phylodynamics to study epidemic dynamics
- Generate and interpret time-calibrated phylogenies from pathogen genetic data
- Learn about the information we can extract from those phylogenies, in particular epidemic origin and role of populations

### Content and structure

Participants will work on a practical case to discover the value of pathogen genetic sequences in studying infectious disease spread.

Participants will be divided into three groups and will receive a different epidemic scenario along with epidemiological information. From this data, each group will start to discuss whether the origin date of the epidemic and the role of populations in the epidemic spread (sink, source, bridge, etc.) can
be identified.

Then, they will receive the specific dataset of pathogen genetic sequences associated to their scenario. Again, each group will have to identify the origin date of the epidemic and the role of populations in the epidemic spread (sink, source, bridge, etc.) using a tutorial.

Key concepts and tools of genomic epidemiology and phylodynamics will be introduced during the outbreak investigation, guided by the facilitators. Software deployment will be handled by docker containers to speed up the set-up process.

During the last part of the workshop, participants will present and share their findings to the other groups.
