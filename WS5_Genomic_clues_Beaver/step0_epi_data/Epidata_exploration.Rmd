## New outbreak in Beavers

We have received several reports of a new disease in beavers. The quick spread across Sweden and the high letality of the disease ....

Here you can find a summary of the reported cases so far:
```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
